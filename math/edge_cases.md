In general, the time-complexity is $\mathcal{O}(S)$ where $S$ is the sum of lengths of all strings.
In the worst-case, all $n$ strings have the same length $m$, giving a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n*m)$.
In the best case, the time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(n*m_{min})$, where $m_{min}$ is the minimum length of a string.

The trie can be built in time $\mathcal{O}(S)$, where $S$ is defined same as above.
In the worst-case, all $n$ strings are equal and have the same length $m$. Thus, $S=n*m$ and the trie will be traversed to a depth of $m$. This gives an overall worst-case time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n*m)$.
The space complexity is $O(S)$.

Real numbers, (also called measuring numbers or measurement numbers). This includes all numbers that can be written as a decimal. This includes fractions written in decimal form e.g., $0.5,0.75,2.35,-0.073,0.3333,2.142857$. It also includes all the irrational numbers such as $\pi, \sqrt{2}$, etc. Every real number corresponds to a point on the number line.
